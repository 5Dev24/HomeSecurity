Newlines are not present in the packet, they're only show to better split
up the segments of the packet to make it more human readable. The 0 is the
flag byte. The flag byte specifies if the packet is ecrypted and must be
present in all packet types. There is no session id present as session ids
only exist for encrypted traffic. This packet structure is only used in the
Key Exchange protocol. No other protocol can use it due to is lacking the
protocol id bytes, nonce, mac tag, step and randoms.

Max length = 65544 bytes (excluding leading flag byte)
	65545 bytes including the flag byte

A = Packet length, base 256 (3 bytes)
B = Device version, major, minor, and patch as individual bytes (3 bytes)
C = Protocol ID, two bytes as this is only for Key Exchange versions (1 byte)
D = Payload, first two bytes are length (base 256), the reset is the message
	itself (2 bytes + 65535 bytes = 65537 bytes)
