Newlines are not present in the packet, they're only show to better split
up the segments of the packet to make it more human readable. The 1 is the
flag byte. The flag byte specifies if the packet is ecrypted and must be
present in all packet types. Protocol id, session id, nonce, and mac tag
all must be present as any other protocol can use this, the nonce and mac
tag are needed to decrypt the payload, and the session id is needed to
get the shared aes key.

Max length = 66441 bytes (excluding leading flag byte)
	66442 bytes including the flag byte

A = Packet length, base 256 (3 bytes)
B = Device version, major, minor, and patch as individual bytes (3 bytes)
C = Protocol ID, first byte is the length, rest is the id in
	base 256 (1 byte + 255 bytes = 256 bytes)
D = Step, base 256, generated like step // 256 % 256, step % 256.
	Never resets, only overflows, overflows at 65535, 65536 = 0 (2 bytes)
E = Session ID (32 bytes)
F = Nonce (16 bytes)
G = Mac Tag (16 bytes)
H = Previous Random (32 bytes)
I = Next Random (32 bytes)
J = Payload, first two bytes are length, in base 256, the rest is the
	encrypted text (2 bytes + 65535 bytes = 65537 bytes)
K = Signature, signature of the entire packet excluding itself and the flag bit (512 bytes)
