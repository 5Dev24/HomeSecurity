# Home Security

## Setup

#### Coming soon

## Purpose

This project was originally started for my sophmore year of high school as my ISM project
for the year. Due to covid and delays due to the amount of research needed for this
project, I couldn't complete it by the end of the school year. I've continued to work on
HomeSecurity after my deadline as, to me, the project is interesting and I want to see
it to its completion or to a state that I'm happy that I've learned a lot from the work.
