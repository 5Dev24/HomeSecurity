# ISM Project 2019-2020 Year

### Introduction

My project, that I came up with, was to create a simple to use, easy setup, no-hassle home security system.
The main system is comprised of a main unit that contains the main system, a raspberry pi, and a keypad.
The reset of the system is comprised of wireless door sensors built from reed switches and raspberry pi 0 w's.
